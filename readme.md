## Technologies Used
This game was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery for DOM manipulation. Audio files and images have also been stored.

## Future Modifications

- Create a multi-level game with larger grid sizes, for example 5x5 grid.
- Make the game more challenging: Show tiles when game begins and inform user to avoid clicking on the farmer. When the farmer is clicked on the tiles will be reshuffled and the user will have to start again.
